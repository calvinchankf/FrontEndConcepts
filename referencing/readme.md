Referencing
===

In Javascript, a variable is always pass by value, but when a variable refers to an object (including arrays), the "value" is a reference to the object.

[Example of passing primitive types](./primitive.js)
[Example of passing an array](./array.js)
[Example of passing an object](./object.js)
